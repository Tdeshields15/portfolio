        <p id="white">My name is Tamajah A. Deshields.</p>
        <p id="black">When the naysayers tell me why I shouldn’t work so hard I remember this quote from author R.S. Grey: "She believed
            she could, so she did.". Then I get back out there with my softball team, get to the gym early for my job as
            basketball manager, and keep my grades up to continue in honors classes. I have a plan, please don’t call it
            a dream. I got into the Thomas Alva Edison High School CTE nursing program which will give me three years of
            specialized science course work in preparation for college. I also got into SMASH@Wharton summer STEM academy
            which is a three years long scholarship program. I am always working. This summer I have struggled to learn how
            to live away from home and take responsibility for myself, but I won’t give up. I will succeed and be invited
            to return for another summer at SMASH and I will continue with honors classes while also completing the CTE nursing
            program so I can achieve my ambitions to be an RN and a Surgical Nurse because I believe I can, so I will.
